## Introduction

Dockerfile to build a [MariaDB Server](https://mariadb.org) Image.

* Configuration tweaked to use all around settings for general usage - Can be changed
* Can use official Mysql/MariaDB environment variables (MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD)
* Allows for automatically creating multiple databases on container initialization
* Automatic Table/DB Upgrade support if MariaDB version has changed
* Includes MySQL Tuner inside image to optimize your configuration
* Zabbix Monitoring for metrics

Also has the capability of backing up embedded in the container based on the [rusxakep/dbbackup](https://github.com/rusxakep/docker-db-backup) image which includes the following features:

* dump to local filesystem
* Backup all databases
* choose to have an MD5 sum after backup for verification
* delete old backups after specific amount of time
* choose compression type (none, gz, bz, xz)
* select how often to run a dump
* select when to start the first dump, whether time of day or relative to container start time

* This Container uses a [customized Alpine Linux base](https://hub.docker.com/r/rusxakep/alpine) which includes [s6 overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) enabled for PID 1 Init capabilities, [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org) for individual container monitoring, Cron also installed along with other tools (bash,curl, less, logrotate, mariadb-client, nano, vim) for easier management. It also supports sending to external SMTP servers..

## Prerequisites


## Installation

Automated builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rusxakep/mariadb) and is the recommended method of installation.

```bash
docker pull rusxakep/mariadb
```

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](/examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.

## Configuration

### Data-Volumes

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory           | Description                                                    |

## Maintenance
### Shell Access

For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell.

```bash
docker exec -it (whatever your container name is e.g. mariadb) bash
```

#### Mysql Tuner

This image comes with [Mysql Tuner](https://github.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl). Simply enter inside the container and execute `mysql-tuner` along with your arguments.

Manual Backups can be perforemd by entering the container and typing `backup-now`
